# Probability Calculation Methodology

This document explains how card draw probabilities are calculated in the Balatro Card Probability Calculator.

## The Problem

Calculate the probability of drawing at least N specific cards when drawing X cards from a modified deck.

Example: "What is the probability of drawing at least 2 Aces when drawing 7 cards from my current deck?"

## The Solution: Hypergeometric Distribution

This is a classic hypergeometric distribution problem. The hypergeometric distribution models the probability of k successes in n draws from a finite population without replacement.

### Why Hypergeometric?

When you draw cards from a deck:
- Population is finite (your deck has a specific number of cards)
- Drawing without replacement (once you draw a card, it's not available for the next draw)
- Each draw affects the probability of subsequent draws

This is different from binomial distribution, which assumes replacement or an infinite population.

## The Mathematics

### Formula

```
P(X >= k) = 1 - P(X <= k-1)
```

Where:
- **N** (deck_size): Total cards in the deck
- **K** (matching_cards): Number of cards that match your search criteria
- **n** (draw_count): Number of cards you're drawing
- **k** (min_matches): Minimum number of matches you want

### Probability Mass Function

The probability of getting exactly k matches is:

```
P(X = k) = C(K, k) × C(N-K, n-k) / C(N, n)
```

Where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient "n choose k".

### Cumulative Distribution Function

The probability of getting k or fewer matches is:

```
P(X <= k) = Σ P(X = i) for i = 0 to k
```

### Calculating "At Least" Probabilities

Since we want "at least k matches", we calculate:

```
P(X >= k) = 1 - P(X <= k-1)
```

## Implementation

The application provides **two types of calculations**:

### 1. Simple Card Draw Probabilities (Hypergeometric Distribution)

Used for calculating individual card type probabilities in the discard table:

**Frontend Implementation (TypeScript)** using the **complement approach**:

```typescript
function calculateProbability(
  deckSize: number,
  matchingCards: number,
  drawCount: number,
  minMatches: number
): number {
  // Impossible scenarios
  if (matchingCards < minMatches) {
    return 0.0;
  }

  // Guaranteed scenarios
  const nonMatchingCards = deckSize - matchingCards;
  if (nonMatchingCards < drawCount - minMatches + 1) {
    return 1.0;
  }

  // Calculate P(X >= min_matches) = 1 - P(X <= min_matches - 1)
  if (minMatches === 1) {
    // P(X >= 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)
    return 1 - hypergeomPmf(0, deckSize, matchingCards, drawCount);
  } else {
    // P(X >= min_matches) = 1 - P(X <= min_matches - 1)
    return 1 - hypergeomCdf(minMatches - 1, deckSize, matchingCards, drawCount);
  }
}
```

This provides exact probabilities for questions like "What's the probability of drawing at least 1 Ace when discarding 3 cards?"

### 2. Poker Hand Probabilities After Discard

Used for calculating complete poker hand probabilities in the hand view:

**Exact Enumeration Approach**:

```typescript
function calculateHandProbabilities(
  currentHand: Card[],
  selectedForDiscard: Set<string>,
  remainingDeck: Card[]
): HandProbabilities {
  const keptCards = currentHand.filter(card => !selectedForDiscard.has(card.id));
  const discardCount = selectedForDiscard.size;

  // Balatro rule: Maximum 5 discards
  if (discardCount > 5) {
    throw new Error('Cannot discard more than 5 cards in Balatro');
  }

  // Enumerate ALL possible draw outcomes
  // C(47,5) = 1,533,939 max combinations - fast enough for exact calculation
  const handCounts = countPokerHandsInAllCombinations(keptCards, discardCount, remainingDeck);

  // Calculate exact probabilities
  return handCounts.map(count => count / totalCombinations);
}
```

**Why Enumeration Instead of Formula?**

Poker hands don't follow simple hypergeometric distributions because:
- Multiple overlapping patterns (e.g., Full House contains Three of a Kind)
- Complex detection logic (e.g., Straights require specific rank sequences)
- Conditional dependencies between hand types

**Why Not Monte Carlo Sampling?**

Balatro limits discards to 5 cards maximum:
- 1 discard: 47 combinations
- 2 discards: 1,081 combinations
- 3 discards: 16,215 combinations
- 4 discards: 178,365 combinations
- 5 discards: 1,533,939 combinations

All scenarios can be **exactly enumerated in <50ms**. Monte Carlo would give approximate results with unnecessary variance.

**Implementation**:

The code enumerates all C(n,k) combinations of drawing k cards from the remaining deck, detects poker hands for each outcome, and calculates exact probabilities as:

```
P(Two Pair) = (# outcomes with Two Pair) / (total possible outcomes)
```

This guarantees **exact results** with no approximation error.

## Examples

### Example 1: Drawing Aces

**Question**: What is the probability of drawing at least 1 Ace in 5 cards from a standard 52-card deck?

**Parameters**:
- N (deck_size) = 52
- K (matching_cards) = 4 (there are 4 Aces)
- n (draw_count) = 5
- k (min_matches) = 1

**Calculation**:
```
P(X >= 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)
P(X = 0) = C(4, 0) × C(48, 5) / C(52, 5)
P(X = 0) = 1 × 1,712,304 / 2,598,960
P(X = 0) = 0.659
P(X >= 1) = 1 - 0.659 = 0.341
```

**Result**: 34.1% probability

### Example 2: Drawing Hearts

**Question**: What is the probability of drawing at least 2 Hearts in 7 cards from a standard deck?

**Parameters**:
- N = 52
- K = 13 (there are 13 Hearts)
- n = 7
- k = 2

**Calculation**:
```
P(X >= 2) = 1 - P(X <= 1)
P(X <= 1) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1)
```

After calculating both terms and summing:
```
P(X >= 2) = 0.697
```

**Result**: 69.7% probability

### Example 3: Drawing Red Cards

**Question**: What is the probability of drawing at least 3 Red cards in 8 cards?

**Parameters**:
- N = 52
- K = 26 (26 red cards: 13 Hearts + 13 Diamonds)
- n = 8
- k = 3

**Result**: 93.7% probability

## Edge Cases

### Impossible Scenarios

When you request more matches than exist:

```python
# Drawing 5 Aces when only 4 exist
calculate_probability(52, 4, 5, 5)  # Returns 0.0
```

### Guaranteed Scenarios

When there aren't enough non-matching cards to fill the draw without getting matches:

```python
# 50 Aces in 52 cards, draw 5, need 1 Ace
# Only 2 non-Aces exist, can't draw 5 cards without getting an Ace
calculate_probability(52, 50, 5, 1)  # Returns 1.0

# This uses the formula: non_matching_cards < (draw_count - min_matches + 1)
# In this case: 2 < (5 - 1 + 1) = 2 < 5, so guaranteed
```

The logic accounts for the minimum matches requirement: if you need at least N matches and there aren't enough non-matching cards to avoid getting N matches, the probability is 100%.

## Input Validation

Before calculating, the application validates:

1. **Deck size >= 1**: Must have at least one card
2. **Matching cards <= deck size**: Can't have more matches than total cards
3. **Draw count <= deck size**: Can't draw more than the deck contains
4. **Min matches <= draw count**: Can't require more matches than cards drawn
5. **Min matches >= 1**: Must request at least 1 match

Invalid inputs return clear error messages.

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity

- Binomial coefficient calculation: O(k) where k is the smaller of (n, k) in C(n, k)
- PMF calculation: O(1) for single probability
- CDF calculation: O(k) where k is the upper bound

For typical card game scenarios (n <= 52, k <= 13), calculations are near-instantaneous.

### Numerical Stability

The implementation uses integer arithmetic for binomial coefficients until the final division, minimizing floating-point errors. The iterative multiplication approach avoids factorial overflow for reasonable input sizes.

## Why Not Use scipy or Approximations?

### Why Native Implementation Instead of scipy?

Cloudflare Workers Python environment does not support scipy. While scipy would provide a well-tested hypergeometric distribution implementation, the platform constraint requires a native solution.

The native implementation is appropriate because:
- Small population sizes (52-card deck) make exact calculation fast
- Hypergeometric distribution formulas are straightforward to implement
- Comprehensive test suite validates correctness
- No external dependencies simplifies deployment

### Why Exact Calculation Instead of Approximations?

For small population sizes (like a 52-card deck), exact calculation is:
- Fast enough (sub-millisecond)
- More accurate than approximations
- Simpler to implement and verify

Normal or binomial approximations would introduce unnecessary error for negligible performance gain.
